Designed for retro computing fans, programming students, and anyone curious about how spreadsheet engines work under the hood.

## Features

Absolute cell referencing (e.g., A1)

Formula parsing (e.g., A1=SUMB1..B10)

Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /

Function support: SUM, AVER, MAX, MIN, STDDEV

Terminal navigation with custom key bindings

Save/Load to/from .csv files functionality
